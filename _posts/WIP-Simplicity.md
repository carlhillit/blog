Keeping systems and configurations simple pays off massively for everyone in the long run.

"The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple."
- albert einstein

Its easy to make complex systems.
More features and capabilities are added as time goes along.
More error handling, inout validation, and guardrails are tacked on because one time it disnt go the way it was supposed to.
Then when your creation is ready for prime time, it resembles this big clunky Tube-Goldberg device (or the boardgame Mouse Trap if that's easier to picture).
It ends up being fragile instead of robust because all thr numerous components that comorise this behemoth must all work in perfect synchronization or it doesnt work at all.
Sound familiar? I know ive been there. We in the IT business like to soove problems. Thise of us who can code, particularly the ones that can code well, tend to write cose to solve those problems...
and the other problem, and that one little problem that popped up there, and this problems that was created as a side effect of solving this problem over here...
you see where Im going.

Those people that take these complex and overly complicated systems and make them into something simple are the ones who are to be truely admired.


Simple systems are generally more robust because there are fewer components that can potentialy fail.

Simple systems are easier to troubleshoot, especially if the one troubleshooting is not the persin who created it.
