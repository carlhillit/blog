Keeping systems and configurations simple pays off massively for everyone in the long run.

## Keep It Simple

"The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple."
- albert einstein

Its easy to make complex systems.
More features and capabilities are added as time goes along.
More error handling, inout validation, and guardrails are tacked on because one time it disnt go the way it was supposed to.
Then when your creation is ready for prime time, it resembles this big clunky Tube-Goldberg device (or the boardgame Mouse Trap if that's easier to picture).
It ends up being fragile instead of robust because all thr numerous components that comorise this behemoth must all work in perfect synchronization or it doesnt work at all.
Sound familiar? I know ive been there. We in the IT business like to soove problems. Thise of us who can code, particularly the ones that can code well, tend to write cose to solve those problems...
and the other problem, and that one little problem that popped up there, and this problems that was created as a side effect of solving this problem over here...
you see where Im going.

## Smart People Make It Simple
Those people that take these complex and overly complicated systems and make them into something simple are the ones who are to be truely admired.
This is because they can fully understand each component of the system, how they work and interact with other components, and streamline the system to make it simpler.
THAT takes more comprehension and know-how than just adding steps.

## Reliability 
Simple systems are generally more robust because there are fewer components that can potentialy fail.
This is generally understood by most people, but it is still worth stating.


## Troubleshooting
Simple systems are easier to troubleshoot.
If a system has 20 components, one would potentially have to test all 20 components to determine which one is not functioning properly.
Where a 10 component system would be theoretically half as difficult to troubleshoot.
This is especially if the one troubleshooting is not the person who created it.
It is rare that a person works alone.
Creating a system that a teammate can troubleshoot easier and reduce the chances of a single person, or a small group of specialists, being the only ines capable of effective troubleshooting.

## Summary
Throughout my uears of working in IT, I have come to the conclusion that simple systems are better in the long term.
They are more reliable and easier to troubleshoot, especially the larger the number of people responsible for maintaining them.
