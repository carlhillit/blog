Following up on my last video how to export a VM to OVA template, now I'll show how to deploy an OVA with PowerCLI.

## Connect to vCenter Server

In my vm-templates folder, I have a Photon OS OVA that I will deploy to my lab vCenter cluster.

While you can export a VM to OVA from an ESXi host, PowerCLI does not support *deploying* an OVA to an ESXi host.
If you attempt to, it will show the error "Invalid URI" when running the `Import-VApp` command

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/deployova/invaliduri.jpg)

The only supported option is to [connect to the vCenter server](https://developer.vmware.com/docs/powercli/latest/vmware.vimautomation.core/commands/connect-viserver/#Default).
